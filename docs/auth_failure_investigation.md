# üî¥ CRITICAL: Authentication Failure Investigation Report
## Reserve St Network - Skycomm Organization

**Investigation Date**: August 29, 2025  
**Severity**: HIGH  
**Impact**: 349 Authentication Failures in 24 Hours

---

## Executive Summary

**ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**: IoT device incompatibility with MR56 (WiFi 6) access point "Shed AP" causing 98.3% of all authentication failures. The issue is isolated to two Xiaomi/Huawei IoT devices attempting to connect to SSID 4 (Server-Room) through this specific access point.

Despite the failures, these devices ARE eventually connecting after multiple retries, causing unnecessary network overhead and log pollution.

## Investigation Findings

### 1. FAILURE CONCENTRATION
```
Total Auth Failures: 349
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Shed AP (Q3AB-STUE-M6HG): 343 failures (98.3%)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Bathroom AP (Q2PD-SRPB-4JTT): 3 failures (0.9%)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Table AP (Q2PD-KWFG-DH9J): 3 failures (0.9%)
```

**Conclusion**: Problem is isolated to ONE access point

### 2. AFFECTED CLIENTS
Only 8 unique clients experienced auth failures, but 2 account for 95% of failures:

| MAC Address | Device Name | Failures | % of Total | Vendor |
|------------|-------------|----------|------------|---------|
| 34:98:7a:ec:73:8f | vf3-co2 | 282 | 80.8% | Xiaomi/Huawei |
| 34:98:7a:ec:6c:ce | sr-r4-r5-bottom-light | 52 | 14.9% | Xiaomi/Huawei |
| 34:98:7a:ec:74:4d | Unknown | 9 | 2.6% | Xiaomi/Huawei |
| Others | - | 6 | 1.7% | Various |

**Key Insight**: All problem devices are Chinese IoT devices (CO2 sensor, smart light)

### 3. SSID ANALYSIS
```
SSID 4 (Server-Room): 344 failures
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Authentication: WPA2-PSK
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ VLAN: 420 (Tagged)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ IP Mode: Bridge
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Status: Clients ARE connected despite failures
```

Other SSIDs have minimal failures (5 total), confirming issue is specific to Server-Room SSID.

### 4. FAILURE PATTERN

#### Timing Analysis:
- **Peak Hours**: 13:00-17:00 UTC (highest failure rate)
- **Retry Pattern**: Every 50-260 seconds
- **Success Rate**: Eventually connects after 3-5 attempts

#### Failure Timeline for Problem Client:
```
15:17:06 - Auth Fail ‚Üí Retry in 80s
15:18:26 - Auth Fail ‚Üí Retry in 100s  
15:20:06 - Auth Fail ‚Üí Retry in 50s
15:21:00 - Auth Fail ‚Üí Retry in 120s
15:23:00 - SUCCESS (Connected)
```

### 5. ACCESS POINT COMPARISON

| AP Model | AP Name | Auth Failures | RF Profile | Radio Config |
|----------|---------|---------------|------------|--------------|
| MR56 (WiFi 6) | Shed AP | 343 ‚ö†Ô∏è | None ‚ùå | Auto/None ‚ùå |
| MR33 (WiFi 5) | Bathroom | 3 ‚úÖ | Configured ‚úÖ | Configured ‚úÖ |
| MR33 (WiFi 5) | Table | 3 ‚úÖ | Configured ‚úÖ | Configured ‚úÖ |

**Critical Finding**: The problematic AP is the only WiFi 6 (802.11ax) model and lacks proper RF configuration

## Root Cause Analysis

### PRIMARY CAUSE: WiFi 6 AP Compatibility Issue

The MR56 (Shed AP) is experiencing compatibility issues with older IoT devices due to:

1. **WiFi 6 Strict Standards Enforcement**
   - MR56 implements stricter WPA2 4-way handshake timing
   - IoT devices with older WiFi chips can't meet timing requirements
   - Authentication times out before completion

2. **Missing RF Profile Configuration**
   - Shed AP has NO RF profile assigned (others do)
   - Radio channels set to None/Auto
   - May cause channel hopping during authentication

3. **VLAN Tagging Complexity**
   - VLAN 420 tagging on Bridge mode
   - MR56 may handle VLAN tagging differently during auth
   - IoT devices struggle with tagged frames during handshake

4. **Firmware/Driver Mismatch**
   - MR56 running: wireless-31-1-8
   - Xiaomi/Huawei devices likely have outdated drivers
   - Known issues with Chinese IoT devices and enterprise WiFi

## Impact Assessment

### Current Impact:
- **Log Pollution**: 349 error entries per day
- **Network Overhead**: ~350 unnecessary auth attempts
- **Monitoring Noise**: False positives in security monitoring
- **User Experience**: Delayed initial connections for IoT devices

### Potential Risks:
- **Security Monitoring**: Real attacks could be hidden in noise
- **AP Performance**: Excessive auth processing on Shed AP
- **IoT Reliability**: Devices may fail to reconnect after power loss
- **Compliance**: Failed auth logs may trigger audit concerns

## Recommended Solutions

### üî¥ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Do Today)

#### 1. Configure RF Profile for Shed AP
```python
# MCP Tool Command:
update_device_wireless_radio_settings(
    serial='Q3AB-STUE-M6HG',
    rf_profile_id='indoor'  # Match other APs
)
```

#### 2. Set Manual 2.4GHz Channel for IoT Stability
```python
# Force 2.4GHz to stable channel
update_device_wireless_radio_settings(
    serial='Q3AB-STUE-M6HG',
    two_four_ghz_settings={
        'channel': 6,  # Or 1/11 based on scan
        'channelWidth': 20,
        'targetPower': 15
    }
)
```

#### 3. Create Dedicated IoT SSID (Workaround)
- New SSID 5: "IOT-Legacy"
- WPA2-PSK only
- No VLAN tagging
- 2.4GHz only
- Bind to specific APs if possible

### üü° SHORT-TERM FIXES (This Week)

#### 1. Firmware Update Check
```bash
# Check available firmware
GET /networks/{network_id}/devices/{serial}/firmware

# Update if newer version available
PUT /networks/{network_id}/devices/{serial}/firmware
```

#### 2. Adjust WPA2 Settings for SSID 4
- Enable WPA2 Enterprise with PSK fallback
- Or implement Identity PSKs for problem devices
- Consider PMF (Protected Management Frames) settings

#### 3. Implement Band Steering Exception
- Force problem MACs to 2.4GHz only
- Prevents 5GHz association attempts

### üü¢ LONG-TERM SOLUTIONS (This Month)

#### 1. IoT Network Segregation
- Dedicated IoT VLAN without tagging
- Simplified authentication (WPA2-PSK only)
- Restricted to 2.4GHz band
- Lower minimum bitrate (1 Mbps)

#### 2. Replace Incompatible IoT Devices
- Identify WiFi 6 compatible alternatives
- Xiaomi/Huawei ‚Üí Enterprise-grade sensors
- Test compatibility before deployment

#### 3. Implement Authentication Monitoring
```python
# Create alert for auth failure threshold
create_network_alert(
    network_id='L_726205439913500692',
    type='auth_failures',
    threshold=50,  # Per hour
    recipients=['network-team@company.com']
)
```

## Validation Steps

After implementing fixes:

1. **Clear Historical Data**
   - Note current failure count
   - Implement fix
   - Monitor for 24 hours

2. **Success Metrics**
   - Auth failures < 10/day
   - No failures from problem MACs
   - Successful reconnection after reboot

3. **Testing Protocol**
   ```bash
   # Force device disconnection
   DELETE /networks/{id}/clients/{mac}/disconnect
   
   # Monitor reconnection
   GET /networks/{id}/wireless/failedConnections
   ```

## Conclusion

The authentication failures are caused by a **compatibility issue between Xiaomi/Huawei IoT devices and the MR56 WiFi 6 access point**, exacerbated by missing RF profile configuration and VLAN tagging complexity. The issue is cosmetic (devices do connect eventually) but creates significant log noise and potential security monitoring issues.

**Recommended Priority**: HIGH - Implement immediate fixes to restore normal operation and prevent security monitoring gaps.
