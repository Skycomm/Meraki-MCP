## Branches Backed Up and Deleted

All branches have been backed up to this folder and deleted from the local repository.
Only the `main` branch remains active.

### Deleted Local Branches:
1. **backup-sse-20250830-135005** - Backup of SSE branch with wireless fixes
2. **backup-stdio-20250830-135005** - Backup of stdio branch with non-wireless improvements  
3. **improved-python** - Old Python improvements branch
4. **network** - Old network tools branch
5. **sse** - SSE branch with 60 wireless fixes (merged into main)
6. **stdio** - stdio branch with event analysis, monitoring, licensing fixes (merged into main)
7. **unified-main** - Temporary unified branch (now is main)

### Remote Branches Still on GitHub:
- origin/improved-python
- origin/network  
- origin/sse
- origin/stdio

These can be deleted from GitHub if no longer needed.

### Current State:
- **main branch**: Contains the unified "super version" with:
  - All 60 wireless fixes from SSE branch
  - Event analysis tools from stdio
  - Monitoring dashboard from stdio
  - Licensing improvements from stdio
  - All duplicate tools removed
  - All syntax errors fixed

### Backup Contents:
Each branch has two backup files:
- `{branch}_history.txt` - Complete commit history
- `{branch}_vs_main.txt` - Comparison with main branch

## Recovery Instructions:
If you need to recover any branch:
```bash
# Check the history file for the commit hash you need
cat branch_backups/20250830_140058/{branch}_history.txt

# Create a new branch from that commit
git checkout -b recovered-branch {commit-hash}
```
